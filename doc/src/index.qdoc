\title Sailfish SDK User Manual

To ease development of applications for Sailfish OS and to make sure paths for
the applications are set correctly and application startup time is
accelerated, third party applications on Sailfish OS should use libsailfishapp.
This library provides certain convenience functions within the \c SailfishApp
namespace to set up your project, install all files into the right directories,
and get important paths at runtime via convenience methods.

This document also serves to describe the functionality of libsailfishapp so
that developers who cannot use it in their projects can use the info provided
here as a guide for how to replicate the directory layout and paths. However,
we generally recommend using libsailfishapp where possible, as it will allow
applications to easily and automatically integrate well with Sailfish OS.
